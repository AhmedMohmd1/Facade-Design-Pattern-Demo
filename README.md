# Facade Design Pattern Demo
Â Demonstrating the facade design pattern is the purpose of this project.Â As an object-oriented design pattern, the Facade Design Pattern simplifies the interface of complex systemsÂ ofÂ components.Â The project consists of eightÂ pages.Â There are different components and methods on each page.Â With the Facade Design Pattern, users can interact with these pages without worrying about complexity. TheÂ demoÂ alsoÂ includesÂ sampleÂ codeÂ soÂ users can see how the pattern works.
