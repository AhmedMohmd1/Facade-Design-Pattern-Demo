# Facade Design Pattern Demo

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the Facade Design Pattern. As an object-oriented design pattern, the Facade Design Pattern simplifies the interface of complex systems of components. In this demo, we showcase how the Facade Design Pattern can be used to simplify interaction with a complex system of components.

># Lessons Learned

In this project, you will learn about the Facade Design Pattern and how it can be applied to simplify the interface of complex systems of components. You will learn about the benefits of using the pattern, including improved user experience, reduced complexity, and improved maintainability.

Specifically, you will learn:

1) What is the Facade Design Pattern?
2) When and how to apply the Facade Design Pattern
3) Best practices for using the Facade Design Pattern in your projects
